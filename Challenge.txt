Challenge: Write a Python script to automatically backup files from a local directory to an S3 bucket on AWS.

Requirements:

The script should accept the name of the local directory to backup and the name of the S3 bucket as command-line arguments.
The script should use the boto3 module to connect to the AWS account and upload the files to the specified bucket.
The script should create a new folder in the bucket with the current date as the name, and upload the contents of the local directory to that folder.
The script should handle errors gracefully, and should output an error message if it is unable to connect to the S3 bucket or upload the files.
The script should be able to run on both Windows and Linux platforms.
